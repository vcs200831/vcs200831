🚀 About Me
### 
Hi, I'm Chandrashekhar, a software engineer from India with a background in computer engineering. I'm currently focused on backend development, building APIs and backend systems using Python and FastAPI through hands-on projects.

I started my programming journey with languages like C, C++ and C#, which helped me build strong fundamentals. Over time, I shifted my focus toward backend development and enjoy working on API design, backend logic, and deploying applications to real environments.

I believe in learning by doing, improving step by step, and writing clean, understandable code. I regularly practice problem-solving and work on small to medium projects to strengthen my skills.

You'll often find me practicing coding problems on LeetCode and experimenting with backend projects here on GitHub.
